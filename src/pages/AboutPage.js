    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my blog!I adopt a B2B and B2C approach in building great
      products with technological tools that give businesses and people
      innovative capabilities to meet customers needs. I bring 15 years of
      business experience from the finance, hospitality, marketing and
      advertising industries.When am not saving the world, I enjoy playing board
      games. Eclectic in music as long as it has rhythm Iâ€™ll dance to it. Also a
      very keen eye for photography to document my adventures.
